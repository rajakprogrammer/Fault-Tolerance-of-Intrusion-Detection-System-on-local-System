The IDS is designed for live logging of system
figures, attendance of the amount of loaded CPU and other
indicators, and searching for important differences that may
indicate a threat. It has a multi s-thread architecture that allows
selective agents to engage in the active and constant data mining
and the real-time anomaly identification and system auditing.
A form of thresholds for anomaly detection is when episodes
of occurrence of events that are deemed outrageously off the
normal script are detected to generate email alarms to the system
administrators on possible threats. The IDS is also equipped
with an integrated prototype of a web-based dashboard which
has been developed using the Flask application framework and
Chart tool as for the purpose of real-time graphic representation
of various system performance indices, are facility that enable
users to monitor the status of the entire system
